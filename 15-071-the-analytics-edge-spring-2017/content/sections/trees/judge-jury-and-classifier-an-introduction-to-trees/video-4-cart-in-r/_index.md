Video 4: CART in R
------------------

In the next few videos, we'll be using the dataset [stevens (CSV)](/coursemedia/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/1fae15ece6119c72496aa45be0f4b024_stevens.csv) to build trees in R. Please download the dataset to follow along. This data comes from the [Supreme Court Forecasting Project](http://wusct.wustl.edu/data.php) website.

An R script file with all of the R commands used in this lecture can be downloaded here: [Unit4\_SupremeCourt (R)](/coursemedia/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/4b3d86026f29ac088fd4a59adf74a01e_Unit4_SupremeCourt.R).
